Based on the specific user we need to store the data means . 
 step 1 -  we need to create a schema and attached the user id from the register schema (how to get that user id means follow step 2)
 step 2 - we need to verify the user means , we need to verify the token and get the user id based on the email or id (decoded from json token)
 step 3 -  then we have upload the files using multer or aws and store the data in db. 
                  const fileMetadata = new File({
        userId: req.user._id,
        filePath: req.file.path, // Local file path
        fileName: req.file.originalname,
      });  attach the user id like this with the upload file 
      
    

// Generate pdf or excel based on the user given data.
